# Irma Evacuation Dashboard
## Irma Evacuation Abstract

The Irma Evacuation dashboard was used to track evacuees during Hurricane Irma in Hillsborough County. Our team was given emergency contact information from the Hillsborough County Emergency Center, and were tasked with converting the paperwork into an Excel format. This data was then used to find interesting trends, such as evacuee density per shelter, the origin and destination per evacuee, the age spreads across families, etc.
